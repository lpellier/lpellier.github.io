# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Lucas Pellier, a `22` years old student at `42` School.<br/><br/>
I've entered the school in October 2019 and have since then completed the `Common Core`.<br/>
I am currently looking for a 6-months internship in Web Development. <br/><br/>

My most notable web projects are `ft_transcendence` and `portfoliOS`. They were both built with React in Typescript.
