## Getting Started
The aim of this project is to code a function that reads the next line on any subsequent call from a file descriptor.

### Installation
`git clone https://github.com/lpellier/get_next_line.git && cd get_next_line`

## Usage

Just include the header file in your code and you're good to go!

The bonus function can handle as many as 1024 file descriptors at the same time.
