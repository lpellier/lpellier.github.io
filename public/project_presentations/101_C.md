# 101_C
Here you'll find a collection of projects and lessons I did whenever I gave lessons in C.

# epitech_projects
I helped a student at Epitech School on a number of his projects, which are all in this folder.

These are not the cleanest projects since i'm only doing these to prepare classes for my student.

# learn_c
Lessons I made, consisting of information on specific "chapters" of C accompagnied by related exercices.

# piscine_exercices
A few exercises directly from 42 school's piscine. I used these to test my students.
