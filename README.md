## What is this ?
This is my portfolio! Inspired by modern desktop environments, portfoliOS is in itself a desktop experience.
You can open up apps which come in resizable windows.

Written in Typescript with React.

## Apps
* Server Projects: Folder containing files which are presentations of server projects I've completed at 42.
* C/C++ Projects: Folder containing files which are presentations of C/C++ projects I've completed at 42.
* Dice: Simple dice app.
* Cub3D: Revisited Cub3D (raycasting engine) with a map editor ! (zqsd to move, ae to rotate)
* Pong: Pong game directly taken from my work on ft_transcendence. Multiplayer is disabled because my portfolio has no backend.
* About me: Compilation of information about myself, including my CV.
