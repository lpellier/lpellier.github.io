## What is this ?
This is my portfolio! Inspired by modern desktop environments, portfoliOS is in itself a desktop experience.
You can open up apps which come in resizable windows.

## Apps
### Server Projects
Folder containing files which are presentations of server projects I've completed at 42.
### C/C++ Projects
Folder containing files which are presentations of C/C++ projects I've completed at 42.
### Dice
Simple dice app.
### Cub3D
Revisited Cub3D (raycasting engine) with a map editor !
### Pong
Pong game directly taken from my work on ft_transcendence. Multiplayer is disabled because my portfolio has no backend.
### About me
Compilation of information about myself, including my CV.

## Usage
